    <p>My name is Kyle, and I am a third year undergraduate computer science major at Northeastern University, anticipating graduation in Spring 2022!</p>
    <p>I have completed two co-ops throughout my college experiece so far.</p>
    <p>The first at <a href="https://www.truefit.com/">the True Fit Corporation</a>, a fashion technology company headquartered in downtown Boston. Feel free to check out my resume for more details on the specific work I did there, but this was a great experience for my personal growth as a developer! I had a chance to work on a wonderful DevOps team, working with tons of different technologies and getting my first experience with major software codebases.</p>
    <p>The second at <a href="https://heilatech.com/">Heila Technologies</a>, a cleantech microgrid startup headquarted in Somerville, MA. It was awesome working both in clean energy, and at a rapidly evolving startup. I got the chance to solve new kinds of problems every day, and really work alongside everyone at the company, rapidly adapting to new situations and areas.</p>
    <p>Currently, I am seeking a third and final a co-op opportinity for the later part of this year, with availability from May -
        December 2021!</p>
