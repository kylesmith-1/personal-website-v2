    <h2>This Website <i>(Personal Project)</i></h2>
    <a href="https://github.com/kylesmith-1/personal-website-v2" target="_blank">Code Available on GitHub.</a>
    <p>While I don't claim that the existing design of my website is all that impressive right now, it's a project I'll be actively trying to improve as a I move through my Web Development class this semester!</p>
    <p>The site is hosted via Nginx on a Vultr Virtual Private Server I configured.</p>
    
    <h2>Letterboxd Data Scraping <i>(Personal Project)</i></h2>
    <a href="https://github.com/kylesmith-1/" target="_blank">Code Available on GitHub.</a>
    <p>Letterboxd is a rating, reviewing, logging, etc. site for movies. You can also make a watchlist, keeping track of movies you want to see. I wanted to see watchlist movies in common with my friends, so I wrote a Python program to parse the public letterboxd pages with Beautiful Soup, and gather movies in common between people's watchlists.</p>
    <p>Ideas for improvements I have are using a more efficient algorithm for finding commonality between lists, as well as integrating this into a useable web app.</p>
    
    <h2>Web Development Class Projects <i>(Academic Projects)</i></h2>
    <p>I have a separate site for the projects I am doing for my current Web Development Class. All the results can be seen over at <a href="http://devcalibur.com" target="_blank">devcalibur.com</a>.</p>
    <p>Some of the noteworthy assignments:</p>
    <p>    - <a href="http://hw02.devcalibur.com/calc/calc.html" target="_blank">Javascript Basic Calculator</a></p>
    <p>    - <a href="http://hw03.devcalibur.com/" target="_blank">ReactJS Cowns and Bulls Game.</a></p>
    <p>    - <a href="http://hw04.devcalibur.com/" target="_blank">Functions built in Elixir. Notably an order of operations supporting calculator using postfix conversion to execute.</a></p>

    <h2>Spreadsheet Software <i>(Academic Project)</i></h2>
    <p><i>I cannot publicly share code for most academic projects, code availabile upon request.</i></p>
    <p>Built in Model-View-Controller architecture, replicates basic functionality of Sheets/Excel, allowing
        for arithmetic operations, recursive cell references, and infinite scrolling/generation of cells (Java)</p>
    
    <h2>Robotic Arm Laucher Software <i>(Academic Project)</i></h2>
    <p><i>I cannot publicly share code for most academic projects, code availabile upon request.</i></p>
    <p>Program sends bursts of simple signals to servo motors on a robotic arm to enable complex motion: picking up and throwing projectiles at targets (C++)</p>
    
    <h2>Maze Solver Software <i>(Academic Project)</i></h2>
    <p><i>I cannot publicly share code for most academic projects, code availabile upon request.</i></p>
    <p>Randomly generates a maze of specified size, animates a depth or breadth-first search, and reveals at the end the true shortest possible path (Java)</p>
